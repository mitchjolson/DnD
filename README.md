# D&D Project

This project is a web application for D&D Game Masters. It will serve as a database for monsters, spells, conditions, and miscellaneous rules, while also providing a combat-tracking tool. The combat tracker will allow the GM to add player characters and monsters, track their initiative, health, and conditions, and easily see their stats and abilities.

This version uses Material UI, Javascript, React, Redux, Node.js, Express.js, and PostgreSQL (a full list of dependencies can be found in `package.json`).
